WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net SPI_CS_OBUF is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1155 - Issue with pin connections and/or configuration
   on block:<Inst_PhaseController/Mram_FIFO>:<RAMB16BWE_RAMB16BWE>.  The block
   is configured to use input parity pin DIAP0. There is dangling output for
   parity pin DOPA0.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
